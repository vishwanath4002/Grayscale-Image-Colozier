Image colorization transforms grayscale images into visually convincing color representations, presenting significant challenges due to its inherently ill-posed nature. This report presents an implementation and analysis of multi-path deep learning networks for automatic image colorization. The multi-path approach processes information through multiple parallel pathways to capture both low-level textural details and high-level semantic context without requiring user input or reference images. We implement the dual-path architecture consisting of mid-level feature extraction, global semantic understanding, and fusion decoder components. The system is evaluated on the Imagenette dataset using quantitative metrics including PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and LPIPS. Our experimental results demonstrate that the multi-path approach achieves competitive performance with PSNR of 23.13 dB and SSIM of 0.925, producing semantically plausible colorizations suitable for automated batch processing applications. The method shows particular strength in maintaining global color consistency while effectively combining local texture information with scene-level semantic understanding.
